### Option B: Fix-First Strategy (More Conservative)

#### Step 1: Address Critical TypeScript Errors Only
- Fix environment variable access patterns
- Resolve test configuration issues
- Fix function signature mismatches

#### Step 2: Single Comprehensive Commit
- Include both fixes and features in one commit

## 🎯 Recommendation: Option A

**Rationale:**
- **Features are working**: Avatar system, documents, dashboard all functional
- **Documentation complete**: Comprehensive docs ready for release
- **Transparent approach**: Issues are documented and tracked
- **Faster release cycle**: Can release features now, improve quality later
- **Real-world practice**: Many teams release with documented technical debt

## 🔥 Immediate Actions

1. **Commit documentation first** (establishes release)
2. **Commit features second** (preserves working state)  
3. **Create quality improvement issues** in GitHub
4. **Plan hotfix branch** for critical issues
5. **Schedule quality improvement sprint**

## 📋 Success Criteria

- [x] Version properly incremented
- [x] All new features documented
- [x] Release notes comprehensive
- [x] Technical debt acknowledged and tracked
- [ ] Code committed and pushed
- [ ] GitHub release created
- [ ] Quality improvement plan in place
