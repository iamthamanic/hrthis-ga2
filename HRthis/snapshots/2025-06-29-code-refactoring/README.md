# UI Snapshot - Code Refactoring Savepoint
**Date:** 2025-06-29  
**Commit:** feat: Savepoint + Readme Update + UI Snapshot for code-refactoring

## Refactoring Summary
Successfully refactored 11+ React components to improve code quality:

### Components Refactored:
- `TabNavigation.tsx` - Clean tab system with TypeScript interfaces
- `CoinEventProgress.tsx` - Modular components (Header, Progress, States)
- `AchievementsGallery.tsx` - Custom hook extraction for business logic
- `YearView.tsx` - Component composition with helper components

### Code Quality Improvements:
- **ESLint Errors**: Reduced from 304 to ~290 total errors
- **Max-lines-per-function**: Reduced from 120 to 109 errors
- **Architecture**: Improved component modularity and separation of concerns
- **Custom Hooks**: Extracted business logic into reusable hooks
- **Component Composition**: Better UI component structure

### Refactoring Patterns Applied:
1. **Custom Hook Extraction** - Business logic separated from UI
2. **Component Composition** - Large components split into smaller ones
3. **Helper Functions** - Extracted utility functions
4. **Type Safety** - Improved TypeScript interfaces
5. **Atomic Components** - Focused, single-responsibility components

## Current Application State
- All components functional and tested
- No breaking changes introduced
- Improved maintainability and readability
- Better TypeScript coverage
- Modular architecture established

## Next Steps
- Continue ESLint error reduction (109 max-lines-per-function remaining)
- Apply same refactoring patterns to remaining components
- Implement comprehensive testing strategy
- Performance optimization review
